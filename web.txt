In general, only static languages are amenable to AOT compilation into 
native machine code because machine languages typically need to know the 
type of data, and in dynamic languages the type is not fixed ahead of time. 
Consequently, dynamic languages are typically interpreted or JIT compiled.

The uses of this machine is manifold.

Adding complexity to solve a problem may bring a short-term benefit, but it invariably
comes with an ever-accumulating long-term cost.

When I read that question, I was intrigued. Using closures instead of functions 
tends to be more costly because closures capture some of the environment, and 
that has some overhead. In practice, we usually donâ€™t think about the difference 
when programming, and the choice of one over the other comes down to personal 
preference and what feels right.
